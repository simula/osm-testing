Easily building NS with VNFs including Juju Charms
==================================================

1. Put VNFDs and NSDs into main directory.

2. Put Juju Charms into "juju".
- Charms will be build automatically.
- If referenced by a VNF, a built charm will be copied during VNF build.

3. Run CMake
cmake .

4. Run Make

cores=`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN 2>/dev/null || true`
if [ $cores -gt 1 ] ; then
   export MAKEFLAGS=-j${cores}
fi

make
