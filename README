Easily building NS with VNFs including Juju Charms
==================================================


1. Put VNFDs and NSDs into main directory.


2. Put Juju Charms into "juju".
- Charms will be build automatically.
- If referenced by a VNF, a built charm will be copied during VNF build.


3. Put Python helper files into "vduhelper".
The files will be copied to <charm>/reactive/ during charm build.


4. Run CMake
cmake .


5. Run Make

# To utilise multiple cores (highly usefor for charm builds!):
cores=`getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN 2>/dev/null || true`
if [ $cores -gt 1 ] ; then
   export MAKEFLAGS=-j${cores}
fi

make


5. Instantiate NS

Important:
In the YAML file, "#! NSD <NS name>" references the NS name to ensure it gets built!

./create-ns <yaml-file>
